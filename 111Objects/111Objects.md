# Final Project Proposal
There's this game I play called Marvel Contest of Champions. In the game, there are "alliances" that consists of up to 30 players and alliances can go toe-to-toe in a gamemode called Alliance War. In Alliance War, all 30 players place their "champions" (Marvel characters) on a map. The map has 55 "nodes", each with unique "buffs". Then, the opponent has to fight their way through the map.

There are over 200 champions and 55 nodes per map. I've been keeping track of the success rate of every champion on every node to help my alliance optimize our champion placements. At the end of every Alliance War, I write down where every champion was placed and how many enemy players that champion has knocked out.

I'd like to create an image and number recognition program that can take a screenshot of the game and list the champions in order of node to make the process of tracking KOs/taking data easier.

Here is a Python package I found that might be relevant: <https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/>

Here is an example of a screenshot from the game:
