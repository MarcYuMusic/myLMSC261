# Marc's Variables+Operators Homework
I knew where to start, but wasn't sure at first about how to modify the last few examples in the examples given to match the homework. I looked up some examples online, which I'll link below, but theirs were wildly different. So what I did was took the examples given here and looked at the examples I found online to match them together. What I came up with is pretty different from what I found onlineâ€”I realized that I just needed an inverse (stacks-i) of empty spaces. Easy!
