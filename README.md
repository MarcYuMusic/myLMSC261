## Section 2: Let's Begin

### 2.1: How do you type an "A"?
> When you press a key, you get three representations: the signal from the keyboard, the version in the memory, and the visual representation of the key you pressed.

### 2.2: From Hardware to Software
> It's easier to produce infinite "nothings" like software with great profit margins!

### 2.3: How does code become software?
> Computers understand things character by character structured like a tree. Every character matters.

### 2.4: What is an algorithm?
> "Algorithm" really just means "software". But it makes you sound smart! It's a puzzle, like an graph or a pathfinder.

### 2.5: The Sprint
> Wireframe mock-ups! Show off your project. It's like squiggly linesâ€”put together to display what needs to be displayed.

### 2.6: What's with all these conferences, anyways?
> Gender inequality, panels that drift...
